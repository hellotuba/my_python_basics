## 🖤 What is this?

Nothing fancy.  
Nothing official.  
Just a place where I try things, break things, learn things, and leave tiny Python scripts behind.

It’s basically my digital notebook — but messier.

## 🐍 What You Might Find

- quick tests  
- tiny scripts  
- random experiments  
- stuff I made while learning  
- things I forgot I wrote  

No guarantees that anything here is useful 😄
